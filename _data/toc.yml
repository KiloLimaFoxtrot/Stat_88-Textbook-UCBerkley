# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED TOC FILE.
# You should review the contents of this file, re-order items as you wish,
# and nest chapters in sections if you wish. The ======= symbols represent 
# folder breaks.
# 
# See the demo `toc.yml` for the right structure to follow. You can 
# generate a demo book by running `jupyter-book create mybook --demo`
