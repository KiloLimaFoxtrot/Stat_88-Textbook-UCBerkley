A class starts at 3:10 p.m. Seven students in the class arrive at random times $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_7$ that are i.i.d. with the uniform distribution on the interval 3:07 to 3:12.</p>

A random variable $X$ is normally distributed. The 25th percentile of the distribution is 120 and the 75th percentile is 147. Find the 90th percentile. [Use any method, but it's worth seeing if you can solve the problem without using the mean.]</p>

A simple random sample of 500 students is taken at University A. Independently, a simple random sample of 700 students is taken at University B.</p>
<p>In the sample from University A, 20% of the students are Economics majors. In the sample from University B, 16% of the students are Economics majors.</p>
<p>Is this difference due to chance? Or does University A have a higher percent of Economics majors?</p>
<p>Answer this by performing a test of hypotheses at the 5% level. Your answer should include a null hypothesis in terms of random variables, an appropriate alternative hypothesis, a test statistic, a $p$-value, and a conclusion, along with justifications of all of these.</p>
