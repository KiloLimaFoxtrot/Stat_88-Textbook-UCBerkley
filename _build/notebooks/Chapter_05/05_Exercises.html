A box contains four blank index cards and one that has a gold star on it. Cards are drawn one by one at random without replacement until the gold star appears. Let $D$ be the number of cards drawn.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Find the distribution of $D$.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Find $E(D)$.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> Suppose all five cards were dealt one by one at random without replacement. If you saw the sequence of cards, would you be able to tell whether you were looking at the sequence forwards (that is, in the order in which the cards were drawn) or backwards? If the answer is "no", can you use it to give another justification for the answer to Part <strong>b</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong> Suppose you deal at random without replacement from a standard deck of 52 cards. Use the idea in Part <strong>c</strong> to find the expected number of cards dealt till the ace of spades appears.</p>

In roulette, the bet on a "split" pays 17 to 1 and there are 2 chances in 38 to win. "Pays 17 to 1" means that if a gambler bets one dollar on a split and wins the bet, then her net gain will be 17 dollars. If she loses the bet, then she loses her dollar; that is, her net gain is $-1$ dollars.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Suppose 200 gamblers bet on a split. Find the expectation of their total net gain.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Does your answer to Part <strong>a</strong> depend on whether the 200 bets were on the same or different spins of the roulette wheel?</p>

A coin is tossed four times. Let $X$ be the number of heads in the first three tosses and let $Y$ be the number of heads in the last three tosses.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Do $X$ and $Y$ have different distributions? Explain.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Are $X$ and $Y$ independent? Explain.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> Make a joint distribution table for $X$ and $Y$. It might help to write out all the possible outcomes of four tosses of a coin, though it is not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong> Use your table in Part <strong>c</strong> to find $P(X = Y)$.</p>
<p><strong>e)</strong> Use your table in Part <strong>c</strong> to find $E(\vert X - Y \vert)$.</p>

<p><strong>10.</strong>
Five thousand votes have been cast in an election. Each vote is either for Candidate A or for Candidate B. The voting is over but the results have not yet been announced.</p>
<p>A polling organization wants to estimate the margin of victory for Candidate A. This parameter is defined as the proportion of votes for Candidate A minus the proportion of votes for Candidate B. Note that this margin of "victory" could be negative if Candidate B gets more votes than Candidate A.</p>
<p>The polling organization conducts an exit poll by surveying a simple random sample of 100 voters after all of the 5000 voters have finished voting.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Let $p$ be the proportion of the 5000 voters who voted for Candidate A. Express the margin of victory in terms of $p$.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Let $X$ be the number of sampled voters who voted for Candidate A. Use $X$ to constructed an unbiased estimator of the margin of victory.</p>

<p><strong>11.</strong>
A data scientist believes that a randomly picked student at his school is twice as likely not to own a car as to own one car. He knows that no student has three cars, though some students do have two cars. He therefore models the probability distribution for the number of cars owned by a random student as follows. The model involves an unknown positive parameter $\theta$.</p>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th style="text-align:right">$\text{number of cars}$</th>
<th style="text-align:center">$0$</th>
<th style="text-align:center">$1$</th>
<th style="text-align:center">$~~~~~~~~~~~2$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:right">$\text{probability}$</td>
<td style="text-align:center">$2\theta$</td>
<td style="text-align:center">$\theta$</td>
<td style="text-align:center">$1 - 3\theta$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be the numbers of cars owned by $n$ random students picked independently of each other. Assuming that the data scientist's model is good, use the entire sample to construct an unbiased esimator of $\theta$.</p>
<p>[Hint: Start by finding $E(X_1)$.]</p>
