<p>In probability theory, we are interested in outcomes of experiments that involve chance. We start with a probabilistic <em>model</em>, which is a set of assumptions about the chances governing the experiment. We can then calculate probabilities for how the experiment could come out.</p>
<p>Statistical inference works in the opposite order. We start with observed outcomes of an experiment. We then try to work backwards to make <em>inferences</em> about the experiment that led to the observed outcomes. That is, we try to make conclusions about the chance processes that generated the data.</p>
<p>Data 8 addresses several questions of statistical inference, using simulation and the bootstrap as its primary methods. In particular, it covers <em>tests of hypotheses</em> about the process that generated the data, and also <em>estimation</em> of unknown parameters of that process. In this chapter we address the same questions with a more theoretical perspective.</p>
