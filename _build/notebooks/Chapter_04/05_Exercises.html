<p><strong>1.</strong> At rush hour, passengers in a subway station come down an escalator to the platforms and choose either the Eastbound or the Westbound platform. Assume that each passenger chooses the Eastbound platform with chance 0.8 independently of all other passengers.</p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> Find the chance that the first passenger to choose the Westbound platform is the fifth passenger that you see.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Find the chance that more than 15 passengers choose the Eastbound platform before the first one who chooses the Westbound platform.</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> In the first hour that a bank opens, the customers who enter are of three kinds: those who only require teller service, those who only want to use the ATM, and those who only require special services (neither the tellers nor the ATM).

<ul>
<li>the number that only require teller service has the Poisson (6) distribution,</li>
