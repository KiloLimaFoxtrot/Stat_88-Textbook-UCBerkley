<p><strong>1.</strong> 
There are 2,598,960 different poker hands. Suppose I play poker two times so that each time all hands are equally likely regardless of which hand I got the other time. The chance that I get the same hand both times is equal to (pick one and explain):</p>
<p>(i) $\frac{1}{2598960} \times \frac{1}{2598960}$</p>
<p>(ii) $\frac{1}{2598960}$</p>

A population consists of equal numbers of students in four categories: freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Suppose there are 8 people in the population, and a simple random sample of 4 people is drawn. What is the chance that the sample contains all four categories?</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Suppose there are 800 people in the population, and a simple random sample of 4 people is drawn. What is the chance that the sample contains all four categories?</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> Repeat Parts <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> assuming in both parts that the sample was drawn <em>with</em> replacement. You now have four numerical answers: the answers to <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, and the two you calculated in this part. Give an intuitive explanation of why two of the four numbers are equal, another one is pretty close, and one is quite different.</p>

There are three boxes, each of which contains two coins. One box has two gold coins, one has two silver coins, and one has a gold coin and a silver coin. A box is picked at random and then a coin is picked at random from the box. Given that the coin is gold, what is the chance that the other coin in the box is silver?</p>

A factory has two widget-producing machines. Machine I produces 80% of the factory's widgets and Machine II produces the rest. Of the widgets produced by Machine I, 95% are of acceptable quality. Machine II is less reliable – only 85% of its widgets are acceptable.</p>
<p>Suppose you pick a widget at random from those produced at the factory.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Find the chance that the widget is acceptable, given that it is produced by Machine I.</p>

A company has to provide passcodes to each of $n$ clients. Passcodes will be chosen from a set of $N$ available codes, which for simplicity we will call Code 1, Code 2, and so on. The company decides to choose $n$ codes at random from the $N$ available codes. Under each sampling scheme below, find the chance that Code 1 is chosen.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> The codes are chosen at random with replacement.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</a> and the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky">Amos Tversky</a> looked deeply into people's biases and perceptions of risk. Kahneman's book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">Thinking Fast and Slow</a> became a New York Times bestseller – read it! In it Kahneman describes a study with Tversky in which they asked people the following question.</p>
<p>"A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city. You are given the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue. </li>
<li>A witness identified the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability of the witness under the same circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was Blue rather than Green?"</p>
<p>The most common answer was 80%. What is your answer?</p>

Investigators at the scene of a crime find a footprint that shows a distinctive pattern on the sole. They identify the type of shoe, and then they find that their prime suspect owns that kind of shoe. They put this person on trial for the crime.</p>
<p>After looking at sales patterns and so on, the investigators find that of the 10,000 other people who could have committed the crime, 1 in 1,000 own that kind of shoe.</p>
<p>The prosecution says that given this evidence, the chance that the defendant was not at the crime scene is 1 in 1000.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> The prosecution has made an error called the "prosecutor fallacy." What is wrong with the statement that they have made?</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Help the legal teams by finding the probability that the defendant is guilty given only the evidence described in this exercise. State the assumptions you are making about randomness.</p>
<p>[It might be easier to work in counts instead of percents. Start with the 10,001 people who could have been at the scene, only one of whom is guilty. And make the reasonable assumption that the guilty person is sure to own the type of shoe identified at the crime scene.]</p>
