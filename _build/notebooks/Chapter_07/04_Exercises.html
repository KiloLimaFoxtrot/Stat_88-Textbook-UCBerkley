<p><strong>3.</strong> In roulette, a bet on a "split" pays 17 to 1 and there are two chances in 38 to win. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each time you bet on a split, your chance of winning is $2/38$ independently of all other times.</li>
<li>If you bet a dollar on a "split", then if you win the bet your net gain is $\$17$ and if you lose the bet your net gain is $-\$1$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose you bet on a split on each of 100 spins of the roulette wheel. Let $X$ be your total net gain on all 100 bets.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Find $E(X)$ and $SD(X)$.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Find the chance that you come out ahead, that is, your total net gain is positive.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> 
This exercise is about draws made at random with replacement from the integers $1, 2, \ldots, N$. It is the model we used for estimation in the <a href="http://stat88.org/textbook/notebooks/Chapter_05/04_Unbiased_Estimators.html">German tanks problem</a>.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> In the special case $N = 6$, our model represents rolling a die. Let $X_1$ be the number of spots on one roll of a die. Find $E(X_1)$ and $Var(X_1)$.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> The calculations in Part <strong>a</strong> can be generalized for $X_1$ uniformly distributed on $1, 2, \ldots, N$, to get $E(X_1) = (N+1)/2$ as you know, and $Var(X_1) = (N^2 - 1)/12$. The formula for variance follows by algebra that you don't have to do; you can just use the formula.</p>
<p>Now let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be draws at random with replacement from $1, 2, \ldots, N$, as in the German tanks problem. Denote the sample average by $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$. Find $SD(\bar{X})$.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> In the German tanks problem, we constructed $\hat{N} = 2\bar{X} - 1$ as an unbiased estimator of $N$. (Statisticians often use "hat" notation to represent estimators.) You know that $E(\hat{N}) = N$. Find $SD(\hat{N})$.</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong> Explain how $\hat{N}$ becomes a better estimator of the population size $N$ as the sample size $n$ gets large.</p>
